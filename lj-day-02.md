Wow! so today we started getting into functions using if/else , went a little more on declaring & assign variables, and more on using git.  
I am really liking using the terminal, it reminds me of my younger days messing around with dos/command prompt for windows.  Just a quick note to anyone reading, I love Microsoft and have for the longest time been very very anti Apple, haha. Though now I am opening up a bit more to working with those products, kind of getting hard in todays world to not be around/work with Apple.  

  Something that stuck with me during class lecture time was the discussion on how a string can be empty and the returned value is empty and not "nothing".  
  Though a little weird, I believe I understand why it's an important distinction.  At least from the perspective of the system.  Since Null is a returnable value on it's own, an empty string shouldn't return null, because that value is not null or nothing.  It has a value, which is just empty.  I believe in class the instructor mentioned that functions will always return a value and will work with an empty string value, but some will break or not work properly if the value returned is null.  It's weird to explain even to myself, but I feel like I have a grasp on it.  I'm sure later on it will make more sense when I see or make it happen in real-life application.  

I have also started to notice that in general a main point to why my code isn't doing what I think should happen is because I have either used a keyword as a variable, misspelled a word, or somehow in my monkey brain I forgot to put a closing tag or } somewhere.  I appreciate the instructor showing me some more typical format standards to coding such as when doing if/else  

if (something) {  
} else {  
}  

That way it's almost immediatly seen if I forgot a { somewhere.  I am starting to really dig this.
