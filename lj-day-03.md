# Learning Journal Day 3  

So today was my first time struggling. We learned about array's and loops, in which I really struggled with getting my array to loop properly, and honestly still am a bit lost in the sauce.  
I don't mind being in this position of struggle. I know that in the long wrong it will help build character as a developer. Right now my main issue is getting an correct user input besides the first index in the array thus stopping the loop.  Currently it will only take the first index, and the loop still continues even though one the conditions becomes false which should end the loop.  

On a feelings level, I am getting more and more jazzed about this decision I made to become a developer as the days continue on. The instructor is super helpful and can tell he is excited about being a developer which definetly helps in the arena of keeping all us baby devs motivated, so it is appreciated.  

Something that I need to keep practicing is the rule of not being stuck for more than 15mins.  I have a bad habit of getting sucked into a problem/error and staying there until I reach utter frustration which by then time has just seemed to fly away. Being frustrated isn't such a big deal, I operate fine under stress, it's the time lost that becomes the issue.  My experience in tech is heavily in the Network Admin/Engineer realm, which is a lot of "have to fix this by myself, no one is coming to save me", not that IT doesn't work in teams because you do, but it isn't the same kind of collaborative effort that is in the developer world. I need to actively remember and engage other students faster.  After all, I will most likely never be the only dev on a project and we're all in this together regardless where we are in the world.  We all love tech, we all love to code, and ultimately are here for one another!
