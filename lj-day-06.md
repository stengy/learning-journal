#Learning Journal Class 6  

Well this day was all about objects (literals) and working with the dom.
Honestly objects seem pretty straight forward, granted I am fresh to all of this so I could easily be mistaken especially since I have no real complex apps under my belt.  
However the dom was a totally different story. There just seems so much to it, and being able to completely manipulate your html, browser and code...just a lot to it haha.  

I should say that I was absent this day, so my lecture came from the recorded video, which I am extremely greatful for by the way, and such couldn't ask questions in real time.  It is a little harder for me to think of questions when I can't stop the instructor real time to ask the question as it comes up.  I think it's going to be using dom that is going to cause my biggest hiccups, but like always I will persevere!  

Oh I do like how objects are like functions and loops and if else if statements, where you can keep nesting and nesting.  Though that isn't to say that you should treat it like the movie inception, the instructor suggested no more than going 2 deep, maybe 3 which is about max.  Which is understandable given how much trouble I had stopping a for loop inside of another forloop.
