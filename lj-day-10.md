#Learning Journal Day 10  

Today was a finish up of a review on not just the salmon cookie project but everything that we have covered up until this point.  Which was crazy helpful!  Though I still have some catching up to do for the weekend, and it's a little crunch time to make sure my grade is up to where it needs to be so I can hopefully continue on to the next class without having to take a break.  

We also had a speed test of sorts.  Something that mimics real world life in the industry.  We were paired up, given a design concept and roughly 4-5hrs to make as close to perfect as we could get it.  It was challenging and a lot of fun!  I love collaboration!  It's always interesting how two different minds come together to solve a problem.  The exercise definitely helped with understanding CSS a bit more, not that I am a ninja or anything but the practice was very much welcomed!  A good example of how you add or change something and then the page breaks, fix the page, repeat.  

It was also a good showcasing of how beneficial it is to PLAN! I don't even know what that would have been like had we just tried to jump right in and begin writing code.  Having a plan of action and a visual wire-frame of what you are thinking it should look like helps so much.
