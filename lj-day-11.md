#Learning Journal Day 11  

Today we went over more styling which helped quite a bit.  It definitely helps when looking at everything on a page as just a box.  It makes it easier to think about how to place and move things with putting boxes in boxes and just moving boxes.  It was also good practice for starting top-down and outside-in, as opposed to looking at the entire page as something to create and trying to make it all at once.  

Something I learned that I didn't realize you could do with HTML/CSS was tack on additional tags to be more specific in what you want to have styled.  For example styling specifically lists attached to a class.  I don't know why I didn't think you could do that before, but at least now I do!  

We started a project for marketing/research for a catalog that will go on buses, that is similar to SkyMall mags found on airplanes.  I don't know why but this is very difficult for me.  I felt like I have forgotten everything we have learned up to this point.  Initially I got the required 3 random photos to populate, but when I created a constructor and methods to do the same thing, it no longer would populate the image on the actual web page, though it would still generate a random photo and assign it to a variable, console.log let me know that much.
