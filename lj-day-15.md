# Learning Journal Day 15  

This was the last day before project week!  Which I am both excited and scared for, haha.  Today we went through merge conflicts, since they are going to be expected in the upcoming projects, as well as were shown some preview stuff from the next class, 301 that is.  jQuery seems so fast!  But I can definetly understand how learning that first or becoming dependent on tools such as that could really make you lost when it came time to write vanilla or when a library just doesn't solve your problem the way you specifically need, could really hamstring you.  Though it was pretty delightful to see how quick one could use that library and githubs API to very quickly write your on search engine in about 27 lines of code!!  

We also pitched final project ideas, voted on those to get the projects down to 7 total, and were split into respective groups.  I am going to be on the wine project, which honestly I am cool with.  I would have been ok with being on any project, because like Duncan says you rarely will pick and choose your teammates or projects when working at a job.  Also everyone's idea was honestly very viable and fit a market.  Any one of them, if built, could easily generate interest.  

There is also a project that I plan on trying to collaborate with a fellow student over the break between classes, since it fits something that I personally would like in my geeky life.  

I also think it'd be a great time to maybe start on my live food journal idea.  

Project week is here.  Let the games begin!
