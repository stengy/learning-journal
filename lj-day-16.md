# Learning Journal Day 16  

Woah!  Project week is upon us.  The day started out well in my opinion.  We spent a good deal of time planning which can be only helpful, assigned priorities to large scale tasks, as well as creating a waffle to track all the smaller tasks that need to be completed.  

We decided to start by pair programming just for the sake of speed and blazing through all the tasks.  I think this works pretty well, since having two heads always seems to be better than one when looking at logic, and it's always nice to have someone to bounce ideas off of, and having someone with an extra pair of eyes to look for those spelling mistakes that always seem to happen, since typically you won't notice your own spelling mistakes right away.  

By the end of the day we got the very first portion of our project up and working, wich was being able to sign up to become a user, save that data to localstorage, and could successfully login in and it would loop through localstorage and find that user allowing you to login.  Over all I would say things are coming along nicely.
