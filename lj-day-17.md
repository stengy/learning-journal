# Learning Journal Day 17  

Today was insane.  I started off not that comfortable with where we left off on the first day of our project.  I had just finished fixing errors last night for the login and signup forms, so I felt pretty behind.  Especially after hearing where some of the other groups were at and I know it's not productive to start comparing yourself to others, but sometimes it's nice to give a jolt of urgency and granted we have a pretty complex app.  

Eventually we hit a stride and started knocking things out and once we figured out the logic behind the problems we were solving we pretty much blasted through the edit profile page, which was decently complex with forms referencing certain data on a user object, saving and replacing that info back into that object in localstorage and such.  

Then we got to the community page, where you could view other users profile snippet and it got crazy.  There was just a lot of different thought processes behind trying to solve the problem and it became modification/refactor of code and changing ideas about what was gonna be on there.  I think the biggest take away / lesson learned , from this is that your planning phase is so crucial and it will save you lots of time when it comes time to put code to text editor.  As well as it's good to try to stick to your MVP plan/model as much as possible.  Deviating just creates more planning and on time crunch for deadlines that can really hurt the progress and eat up time.  

All in all though I am not complaining, I like my group of people, they're pretty damn smart, and we do get stuff done when we get to it.  It's just good to extract lessons from all situations, and this is just another learning experience.  

On and upward!
