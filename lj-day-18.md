# Learning Journal Day 18  

I will admit today was pretty stressful for me.  We ended Tuesday night on not so clear terms on how we were going to proceed with generating the community page and lost track of exactly how our MVP was going to go about.  However, the head of our team came in with a solid plan and idea on a new master constructor that was more streamline for sure.  

After some initial roadblocks with trying to get the wine review to work with the new model, and struggling with a hard coded test user which never ended up working.  After I just scrapped the test user I ended up getting the review form to work (which we were just going to reference a users array later), I helped with a little debugging and getting the bio form to work a bit with Stephanie.  

We really started making headway near mid to late afternoon.  The motivation and paced picked up.  Over all it was a good day, and though it may have started out a bit stressful it ended on a great note.  

Major lesson learned is how important whiteboarding, wireframming, sudo coding, and general planning is!  Yeah, have to do those things for sure.
