# Learning Journal Day 19  

Today the theme was "I LOVE PROGRAMMING"!  Which was a much needed feeling giving how much of a struggle the beginning of the week was.  We really hit our stride this day.  

MVP was reached and by the night time we were working on CSS , which was completed by the AMAZING Stephanie late into the wee hours.  There was much more white boarding, sudo coding and communication between us.  Again we fell into an amazing groove, and everything started falling in to place.  

My main project for the day was getting the community page to populate with all the users and a specific snippet of information that we wanted to display, which sudo coding helped out immensely .  I find that doing some sudo code on a white board completely removes the stress of staring at a blank text editor and having no idea where to begin because you're trying to think about the entirety of what you want the functions to accomplish.  Definitely a new technique that I will continue to incorporate into my developer life.  

I am proud of the team's work, my work, and our project.  We're on our way to making the world a better place.
